In short: an all-American tale.'\n"," b\"It's not worth shelling out money for in theaters.\"\n"," b'The wacky premise never emerges as anything other than a vessel for endless massive Beatles idolization, which is going to continue for the band whether this movie exists or not.

The actors are magicians, too.'\n"," b'A competently-made animated film crafted specifically for the toddler set, who may enjoy the bright colors and boingy action. Older kids and parents will find themselves, if not quite bored, then only modestly engaged.'\n"," b\"Isn't sure if it is supposed to be a campy homage, a vampire black comedy, or a family friendly horror pic...doesn't come close to the duo's wondrous collaborations.\"\n"," b'This deliberately paced, almost monochromatic movie reserves its real energy and color for blaming the victim.'\n"," b'At 84 minutes it feels remarkably like an extended episode of a good sitcom.'\n"," b\"Charismatic turns from its two stars provide the heartbeat for the movie, which resembles director Edward Zwick's TV show thirtysomething with its insight into male/female intimacy.\"\n"," b'An engaging drama that shows how courage and compassion can change lives in the twinkling of an eye.'\n"," b\"While it overreaches itself at times, it's a warm, engaging and winningly sincere comic drama.\"\n"," b\"Probably the only movie you'll ever see that opens in '1192 -- Year of the Black Rat.'\"\n"," b'\"The Great Wall\" looks great, living up to the promise of \"\\'Starship Troopers\\' only in Ancient China.\"'\n"," b'virtually everything that is enjoyable about it, particularly the show-stopper musical numbers like \"Belle\" and \"Be Our Guest,\" derive their pleasures directly from the animated version'\n"," b\"The film's plot ... feels like a very bland character's search for a personality.\"\n"," b'Women are aggressively objectified for the male gaze, while people of color are simply erased.'\n"," b\"Weitz isn't aiming for sweeping profundity, instead making a character study that's small, sour and sweet - like one of those hard candies your grandma had in a bowl by the front door.\"\n"," b\"These actors convey every inch of this layered emotional terrain.

Like 'Old Yeller' with gore, and a really crummy plot.\"\n"," b\"Everything's bigger in the Lone Star State. Steaks. Football. And really, really bad movies.\"\n"," b\"Never less than astounding visually, but it lacks the consistency in vision of Malick's masterpieces.\"\n"," b'While it would be unfair to saddle MacGruber with the \"worst SNL movie of all-time\" moniker (I can think of at least two that are more painful to endure), its place on the vaunted 2010 Worst 10 list is assured.'\n"," b'Given its flimsy premise, this film comes off not too badly.'\n"," b\"There's nothing like a holiday film that gets you in the spirit of family reunions in all their disastrous glory.\"\n"," b'The film is not only an evocation of a bygone era but an emanation of it as well.'\n"," b'The rousing Oscar-chaser Bombshell dramatizes a case of bad people doing a good thing at the expense of a worse person.'\n"," b\"If for some reason you thought you couldn't get bored of watching a former WWE champion lurching around shooting people in the head, you were wrong.\"\n"," b\"Nothing really changes by the end, because after all there are five more of these waiting to be made if this one somehow manages to strike box office gold. I wouldn't hold my breath.\"\n"," b'It needs a smarter script. It needs at least two or three perfectly engineered, joke-after-joke sequences. It needs a smart director - did you really do \"Wag the Dog,\" Levinson? - whose idea of political satire goes beyond freshman-year sarcasm.'\n"," b'A safe, satisfying drama steeped in classic notions of loyalty and friendship.'\n"," b\"Looks at a man damaged by the psychopathy of his mother, and also encapsulates the '70s fading in the rear-view while 1980 reared its head.\"\n"," b\"No other film I've seen quite captures the feeling of being trapped like Seconds does. Frankenheimer puts it all together with splintered editing that is as bold as it is disorienting.\"\n"," b'This is just a giant slurp of cinematic Sunny D, quenching the thirst for instant fun with CGI sweeteners and a fast-acting concoction of other slapstick additives.'\n"," b'A powerful, piercing, brilliantly acted exploration of the ways in which love can die.'\n"," b'They could have just called it A Million Jokes Die in the West So That Six May Work.'\n"," b'A really solid late-summer surprise and a gem of a crime caper.'\n"," b\"If you can't get out to see it in theaters, don't bother seeing it at all.\"\n"," b\"Framing John DeLorean isn't just a talking heads documentary about an extraordinary man's life, it's also a meditation on fame and media notoriety.\"\n"," b'For all the people who declined to be interviewed for Feruson\\'s\\'s film (Alan Greenspan, Pauling, Larry Summers....), one of the scariest takeaways of \"Inside Job\" is that Frederic Mishkin, the man who was Governor of the Federal Reserve, didn\\'t'\n"," b\"Andres Muschietti's IT, based on portions of King's enormous 1986 horror novel, comes close to capturing the essence of what this author is all about.\"\n"," b\"Life After Beth finds a fresh angle to work and the right cast to work it.

(Not a high bar.)'\n"," b'A quirky, wacky comedy equally smart and silly with plenty of the Monty Python influence'\n"," b'Who knew that the world was clamoring for another spy kid movie at this very moment? If we have to have one, it should be as cheeky and nonsensical as Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker.'\n"," b\"The Scream movies are generally thought of as horror-comedies, but one of the things that makes them such fun is the fact that they're also mysteries.\"\n"," b'Disappointingly formulaic.'\n"," b'Simon Killer is a sensory, experiential film - more of a state of mind than a straightforward story.'\n"," b\"It's well-shot, with some decent effects work, and even though the editing is somewhat manipulative, the story's fanciful flourishes are enjoyably silly.\"\n"," b\"A well-made, arrow-straight, disappointingly conventional version of Shakespeare's greatest potboiler...the film simply droops in comparison to earlier versions.\"\n"," b'Monster House is arguably the best family film so far this summer.'\n"," b'A very special film that deserves a chance with discerning viewers.'\n"," b\"Lee and Schamus make history blandly palatable; in the process, they rob the times and the people they're portraying of their complications.\"\n"," b\"Dirty Grandpa does have one distinction. It makes De Niro's previous comedy low point Meet the Fockers look good by comparison.\"\n"," b'Through silence and vivid details, it was able to create an experience that was not only silly but also beautiful.'\n"," b'After sampling the cuisines of the Lakes District and the land of La Dolce Vita, Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan are back for a third course of gastronomic delights and competitive celebrity mimicry.'\n"," b'Move over Donnie Brasco.

But, if you're okay with a behind-the-scenes look via deliberate conversations, it opens up a new wing of the genre.\"\n"," b'Watching Novak and Taylor lay into each other verbally is a treat. Whether that should be what you come away with from a Miss Marple movie is another consideration.'\n"," b'Dead Snow 2, is certainly not a perfect film, but it ultimately manages to equal the fun factor of its predecessor, which is by no means an easy task.'\n"," b\"You're left wishing the film had a little more faith in its audience, for then this well-put-together movie might have provoked more thought, and slightly less irritation.\"\n"," b'[A] glorious mess of a movie.'\n"," b\"Such a brief glimpse into these women's lives and art whets the appetite for more; alas, Ballerina ends far too quickly, leaving only their willowy shadows behind.\"\n"," b'Three-frame cuts of the action from multiple camera angles, hose-spurted blood and superimposed wounds do what they can in their primitive way to get you past the problem of improbability.'\n"," b\"The Infiltrator is so good you'll think you're watching a TV show.\"\n"," b'Boyd exchanges unrelenting sweetness and conveniently pretty endings for a quiet reminder of the messy uncertainty of evolving relationships.'\n"," b'A film that moves a bit too slowly for its own good but has remarkable cumulative strength by its emotional finale.'\n"," b'Imperfect though it may be, Shirley nevertheless offers enough of an appreciation of what makes Jackson special to warrant some appreciation of its own.'\n"," b'Prometheus is proto-product placement film - where the product is Alien.
